Pointers :

Demonstrate the use of pointers.
Swap two numbers using pointers.
Access array elements using pointers.
Reverse a string using pointers.
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc and calloc.
Declare and initialize a pointer to store the address of a variable.
Access the value of a variable using a pointer (dereferencing a pointer).
Perform basic arithmetic operations on pointers (e.g., incrementing, decrementing).
Use a pointer to a pointer to store the address of another pointer.
Work with pointers that point to the elements of an array.
Use pointers to iterate through arrays and access their elements. 2. Pointer and Functions
Use pointers to pass variables by reference to a function.
Return a pointer to an array or dynamically allocated memory from a function.
Pass a pointer as a function argument to modify the original data.
Create and use function pointers to call functions dynamically. 3. Dynamic Memory Allocation
Use malloc() to dynamically allocate memory for a variable or array.
Use calloc() to allocate memory and initialize it to zero.
Use realloc() to resize previously allocated memory.
Use free() to deallocate dynamically allocated memory. 4. Pointer and Arrays
Access elements of an array using a pointer and pointer arithmetic.
Create an array of pointers and use it to store addresses of different variables.
Work with pointers to access elements of a 2D array.
Use pointers to manage an array of strings (array of character pointers). 5. Pointer to Structure
Create an array of structures and access it using pointers.
Pass structures to functions using pointers to modify structure fields. 6. Advanced Pointer Concepts
Use pointers to store constant values (pointer to constant).
Use a constant pointer to store the address of a variable but prevent the pointer from being reassigned.
Use function pointers to call functions dynamically.
Work with void pointers, which can point to any data type.
Work with an array where each element is a pointer to another array or data type. 7. Pointer-Based String Operations
Reverse a string by manipulating its characters using pointers.
Concatenate two strings by manipulating their characters using pointers.
Compare two strings using pointer-based traversal.
Count the number of vowels in a string by using a pointer to traverse it. 8. Miscellaneous Pointer Programs
Swap the values of two variables using pointers.
Use pointers to iterate through an array and find the largest or smallest element.
Perform matrix transpose using pointers to access 2D arrays.
Implement sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort) using pointers.

Create a singly linked list, traverse it, and perform insertions or deletions. 9. Real-Life Applications Using Pointers
Create and resize a dynamic array using malloc(), calloc(), and realloc().
Use pointers for efficient memory management in large data structures.
Use pointers to simulate file handling (e.g., reading/writing strings to/from files).
Implement a binary search algorithm using pointers to traverse a sorted array. 10. Pointer Challenges
Work with multi-dimensional arrays using pointers (e.g., a 2D matrix with pointer manipulation).
Implement a circular linked list where the last node points back to the first node.
Reverse a linked list using only pointers (without extra memory).
Find the middle node in a singly linked list using two pointers.
